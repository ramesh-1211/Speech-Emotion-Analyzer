# Speech-Emotion-Analyzer

It is a Python-based project that detects human emotions from speech audio. It extracts features like MFCCs and uses machine learning models to classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral. The project is in its initial development stage and will be updated with real-time predictions and advanced models soon.
